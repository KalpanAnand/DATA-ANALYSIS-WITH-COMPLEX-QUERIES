*DESCRIPTION*:

Objective: The core goal is to generate a report that reveals trends and patterns within sales data.  This implies going beyond basic aggregations and exploring more complex relationships.

SQL Techniques: The problem statement explicitly requires the use of:

Window Functions: These functions operate on a set of rows that are related to the current row, allowing calculations like running totals, rankings, and moving averages without the need for self-joins or complex subqueries.

Subqueries: These are queries nested within another query. They can be used to pre-process data, filter results, or perform calculations that are then used by the outer query.

CTEs (Common Table Expressions): These are named temporary result sets that can be referenced within a larger SQL query. They improve readability and modularity, especially when dealing with complex queries involving multiple steps.

Sales Scenario (Example):  The problem statement uses a sales context as an example.  This usually involves data about sales transactions, including information like product IDs, sale dates, quantities, prices, and customer IDs.  However, the principles and SQL techniques are not limited to sales data; they can be applied to any data that can be represented in a relational database.

Report Generation: The ultimate deliverable is a report.  This means the SQL queries should not just return raw data but should present the data in a way that is easy to understand and highlights the key trends and patterns.  This might involve calculations, formatting, and potentially even some basic data visualization (though the focus is on the SQL side).

Advanced Data Analysis:  The problem statement emphasizes "advanced" analysis.  This suggests that the required analysis will involve more sophisticated techniques than simple SUM, AVG, COUNT, etc.  It implies exploring relationships over time (trends), comparing performance across categories (e.g., product rankings), and calculating metrics that require context (e.g., percentage contributions).
